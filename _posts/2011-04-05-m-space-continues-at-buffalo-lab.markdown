We are getting close to a clear direction for this group that meets on prime Fridays of the month (i.e. 2nd, 3rd and sometimes 5th Friday of the month).

ATTENTION! ATTENTION! 5th Friday is movie night! Come and see a meaningful and motivational movie that can help inspire our activities the rest of the time.

Are we a bunch of math nerds? Not really, but math is cool and if there is interest ...

Are we a bunch of computer geeks? (Well who isn't these days?)  Microcontroller technology is hot ...

Music? sure.  Movies? sure.  Mobility? you bet.  Still can't figure it out?  Come on down!

(Discussion for <a href="http://www.buffalolab.org/wiki/M-space">m-space</a> is in the wiki.).
