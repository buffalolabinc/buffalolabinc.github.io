Hello everyone,

We had months of fun, meeting fellow hackers, learning new things. The best part is that now we have our very own space. 3400+ sq feet of pure hacker kung-fu area; â€œyou think thats air youâ€™re breathing?..â€

Its yours; for less than the price of a cup of coffee a day.

Your monthly membership fee will go towards rent, electricity and other expenses for Buffalo Hackerspace which you will officially be a part of. In return, you will gain much much more.
