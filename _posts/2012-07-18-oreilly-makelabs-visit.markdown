  seems I stumbled into the center of the maker movement when moving to Sebastopol,
  Ca. Within a mile of my house, is the Make:Labs, under O'Reilly Media. They are
  the force behind Make: and Craft magazines, Maker Faire, Makezine.com, Craftzine.com,
  Make Weekend Projects videos, the Maker Shed store, and Make Project line of DIY
  books. Although it's a closed shop with hired techies, I finally went and checked
  it out and got the grand tour and snapped a few pics. I found out a little bit about
  what's going on. The biggest project they have going is probably the education initiative
  to make computer labs at schools into makerspaces and get the tech side into the
  physical world. The plan is to start with 1000 schools in 4 years and keep itÂ growing.
  So, here's those pics and an inside look into their space.\r\n"
