The Main-Washington Exchange was one of the venues for this years Buffalo Infringement Festival. While we were helping out (and enjoying the show) we were also working on projects upstairs. Notably we replaced the monitor in the arcade machine and installed a new ethernet drop for it near the kitchen.

We got the cabinet in 2009 and have since repainted it and upgraded the interior with a modern PC. (Classic games are available through emualation.) We preserved the illuminated display, but took out the coin mechanism. This machine also serves as a handy internet kisosk for members.
