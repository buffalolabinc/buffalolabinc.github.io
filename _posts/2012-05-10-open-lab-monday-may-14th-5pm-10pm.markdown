We're open to the public. Non-members are encouraged to come down and check out the space, work on something interesting, or find out what we're planning next. We generally will have snacks, and possibly dinner. You are welcome to BYOB if you'd like to participate in "beer appreciation". We'll also holdÂ our State of the Space Discussion. Members are encouraged to share and work on their projects preferably during open lab when possible.
