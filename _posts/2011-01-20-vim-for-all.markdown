Shawn has been kind enough to provide Vim free to everyone! Well it already was free to everyone, but he is actually showing us peons how to use it! He has scheduled 4 sessions starting at the most basic and up to creating your own extensions/plugins. The first one was tonight, but do not fret; it will be easy to catch up if you look over the notes and come down early before the second class (Shawn is usually here a few hours before).
<h3>Vim Classes - 1 - Getting and beginning Vim</h3>
<strong>Thurs Jan 20th @7:00pm ( <a href="http://www.meetup.com/hackerspaces/calendar/16023181/">Meetup</a> / <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=134273339970625&amp;index=1">Facebook</a> )
Location: 701 Seneca St, 4th Floor</strong>

Absolute intro to vim. If you've heard about how awesome and powerful vim is but haven't used it or were put off by its learning curve this is the class to start. We'll be going over the basic: getting and installing vim and editing a file.
<h3>Vim Classes - 2 - Efficient Editing</h3>
<strong> Thurs Jan 27th @7:00pm (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/hackerspaces/calendar/16023221/">Meetup</a> / <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=193196057364643">Facebook</a> )
Location: 701 Seneca St, 4th Floor</strong>

This class we'll be going over the bread and butter that is vim editing: Motions, operators and commands.
<h3>Vim Classes - 3 - Setting up your environment</h3>
<strong>Thurs Feb 3rd @7:00pm ( <a href="http://www.meetup.com/hackerspaces/calendar/16023247/">Meetup</a> / <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=120212614717703">Facebook</a> )
Location: TBD!</strong>

Now that you're becoming more proficient with vim it's important that you make sure you're comfortable while editing. So in this class we'll go over setting up your environment, customizing your vimrc, picking a colorscheme and choosing a powerful set of plugins.
<h3>Vim Classes - 4 - Extending Vim</h3>
<strong>Thurs Feb 10th @7:00pm (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/hackerspaces/calendar/16023293">Meetup</a> / <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=188407577854471">Facebook</a> )
Location: TBD!</strong>

You're a vim wizard at this point and editing faster than you'd ever thought possible, but you want to go faster and make vim even more powerful. In this class we're going to go over modifying plugins to suit your needs, writing your own plugins, and writing your own colorscheme.

Prereqs: This class is going to involve scripting and assumes a certain level of programming knowledge but myself and the other attendees will glady aid anyone that's unfamiliar.
