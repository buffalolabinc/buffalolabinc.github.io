The <a href="http://www.buffalolab.org/wiki/Member_Meeting_-_January_2011">Member Meeting minutes</a> from Janurary 25th, 2011 have been posted to the wiki. Thank you to all who attended, we had quite a turn out of old and new faces!

If you were not able to attend, please take a minute to read them over. If you have any questions that were not answered, send an email to info@buffalolab.org or get a hold of me (Matt) at the space one of the next few days. Anyone who did attend the meeting, it is appreciated if you could notify me if there are any missing details from the minutes!

One of the big things that came out of Tuesday's meeting was a bunch of projects were created to help us in our efforts to leave 701 Seneca and move downtown. Check out the links in the <a href="http://www.buffalolab.org/wiki/Category:Projects">Projects</a> category on the wiki. If you are interested in helping with a project, get a hold of one of the chairs or email info@buffalolab.org
