<strong>(Late) UPDATE! Oct 7th!</strong>

We made our goal and exceeded it! Buffalo Lab received a total of $1610 in donations from all parties involved. Thank you so much guys!

<hr />Currently our Buffalo Lab owes $1400 in back rent and utilities to the building owners.  This debt MUST be cleared by the end of the week.  If this debt is not cleared, we fear we may be evicted.  This seems like an insurmountable task, but it is only 14 people giving an extra $100!  Please pledge and send in whatever you can to keep our space operational.  It is only through your ongoing support that we exist.

To pledge your $100, you can click the PayPal link below:

<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post"> <input name="cmd" type="hidden" value="_s-xclick" /> <input name="hosted_button_id" type="hidden" value="B8GFRS2JCE8R2" /> <input alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!" name="submit" src="https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif" type="image" /><img src="https://www.paypal.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />

</form>If you would prefer cash or check, you can contact Chris at 716-430-5634 or Matt at 716-980-5556.  Checks should be made out to Buffalo Lab, Inc.

If you can't donate $100, please send whatever you can.  I have included a handy link for that as well!
