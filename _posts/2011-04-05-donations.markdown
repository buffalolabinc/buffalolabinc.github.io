Buffalo Lab is a New York State Not-for-Profit organization. As such, we rely solely on the donations of our members to continue operating. We encourage all members to donate their knowledge, skills, time and money to make Buffalo Lab a successful community organization. If you are working on a project and have an hour to show it to everyone else, schedule a demonstration. Want to help others learn a new skill from or with you? Organize a mentorship program. Have extra cash you have nothing better to spend on? Donate it to Buffalo Lab and help us to continue to provide the space and resources to make the other things possible!
